# nyc-greenthumb-gardens

An app to learn about the GreenThumb gardens in New York City. 

Current Features:
- Filter by borough
- Filter by ZIP code
- Run "reports" of park names and their ID numbers
- Run "report" of most populated zipcodes by borough or overall city
- Randomly pull one up a park to learn more
- Search by park name or ID number

Data pulled from the City of New York's NYC Open Data API.

Admin's Note:
- Certain data fields like "open hours" are available but are not filled in by most parks. Currently difficult to utilize. 
- I would be happyt to build out corresponding voter district info, if interest arose!
